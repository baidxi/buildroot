	  The toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container
	  content.

	  The goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and
	  scalable base for building a large scale registry solution or
	  running a simple private registry. It is a core library for
	  many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container
	  Registry, GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container
	  Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor Project, and VMware
	  Harbor Registry.
