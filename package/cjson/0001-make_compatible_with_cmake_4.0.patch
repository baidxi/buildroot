Subject: [PATCH] Make compatible with CMake 4.0 When trying to build with
 CMake 4.0, the following error is shown:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.

This change raises the minimum required CMake version to 3.5 and thus makes the project compatible with CMake 4.0
